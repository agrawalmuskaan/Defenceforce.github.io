    <center><h1>INDIAN NAVY</center></h1>
    <h3>On December 4th, India celebrates Navy Day to honor the contributions and accomplishments of the Indian Navy to the nation. 
        he Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Navy, the naval component of the Indian Armed Forces, is the President of India. Shivaji, the Maratha Emperor, is regarded as the "Father of the Indian Navy." 
        The Indian Navy plays a significant part in safeguarding the nation's maritime borders and improving India's relations with other countries through visits to seaports, cooperative exercises, disaster assistance, and other activities. 
        In order to strengthen its position in the Indian Ocean region, the modern Indian Navy is undertaking a swift makeover. 
        <br>
        The Indian Navy contributes significantly to maintaining the country's maritime borders and advancing India's international relations through a variety of activities such as port visits, collaborations, patriotic missions, disaster assistance, and many more. The modern Indian Navy has undergone changes to strengthen its relationship with the Indian Ocean region. The Indian Army, Navy, and Air Force are the three branches of the Indian Armed Forces. The Indian Army defends us on land, the Navy defends us in the sea, and the Air Force defends us in the air.
